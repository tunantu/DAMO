# DAMO: Decoding by Accumulating Activations Momentum for Mitigating Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models (ICLR 2025)

## Introduction
This papers aims to mitigate hallucinations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by accumulating visual information from earlier layers, where we found that correct information often appears in the early stage. By refining activations throughout the inference procedure, DAMO effectively preserves essential visual semantics, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.
